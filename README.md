# Todo CLI App

A simple command-line Todo application written in Go. It allows you to add, list, complete, delete, and export tasks. Tasks are saved to a text file so they persist between runs.

## Features

* Add new tasks
* View all existing tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* Delete tasks by number
* **Export tasks to JSON (`tasks.json`)**
* **Export tasks to Toon format (`tasks.toon`)** *(for LLM-friendly task discussion)*
* Persistent storage using a `tasks.txt` file
* Automatic overdue detection (⚠ overdue tasks are highlighted)
* **Startup reminder dashboard** showing:
  * 🔥 Overdue tasks
  * ⏰ Tasks due today
* Filter tasks (overdue, due today, high priority, pending)
* Sort tasks by due date

## How It Works

The application stores tasks in memory and writes them into `tasks.txt` so they are available the next time you run the program. When the application starts, it loads tasks from the file (if it exists).

Each task now has:

* **Text** — the description of the task
* **Due Date** — optional, format `YYYY-MM-DD`
* **Priority** — optional, e.g., `low`, `medium`, `high`
* **Done status** — whether the task is completed

You can export tasks into different formats:

* **JSON** — a structured machine-readable format
* **Toon** — a lightweight, human- and LLM-friendly text format designed for future AI-based task discussion

> Note: Toon export currently exists as an internal function and is not exposed in the menu yet. It is intended for future integration with an LLM chat interface.

## Storage Format

Tasks are stored in `tasks.txt` using this format:

ID|Done|Text|DueDate|Priority

Example:
42|1|Pay rent|2025-12-01|high

This makes it easy to:
- Edit tasks manually
- Sync with other tools
- Write import/export scripts

## ⏰ Overdue Detection

Tasks with a due date are automatically checked against the current date.

A task is considered **overdue** if:
- It has a due date
- It is not marked as completed
- The due date is before today

Overdue tasks are displayed in the task list with:

⚠ OVERDUE

Example:

3. [ ] Pay rent (Due: 2025-12-01) [Priority: high] ⚠ OVERDUE

## 📢 Startup Reminder Dashboard

When the application starts, it automatically scans your tasks and displays:

* 🔥 **Overdue tasks**
* ⏰ **Tasks due today**

This ensures you never miss important work — even if you forget to manually open the task list.

Example:

🔥 OVERDUE:
1. [ ] Pay rent (Due: 2025-12-01) [Priority: high] ⚠ OVERDUE

⏰ DUE TODAY:
2. [ ] Submit report (Due: 2025-12-08) [Priority: medium]

This dashboard appears **before the main menu** every time the app launches.

   ```bash
   go run main.go
